The Off-line HTTP Traffic Uploader

This tool is designed to  upload and analyze the (offline) HTTP traffic of other scanners and analyzers, such as [skipfish], [hoppy], [w3af], [arachni], [ZAP], [Burp], etc.


The plan is to read output files from them and translate these into the following clearly defined fields such as:

* HTTP request
* HTTP response status code
* HTTP response headers
* HTTP response body

A plugin-based uploader system will be implemented, which uploads that into the OWTF database.

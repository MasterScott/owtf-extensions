Mozilla Zest
==============

Zest is an experimental specialized scripting language (also known as a domain-specific language) developed by the Mozilla security team and is intended to be used in web oriented security tools.

It is written in JSON and can be integrated into OWTF to replicate the HTTP transaction (request, response pair) with OWASP ZAP (primarily) or any other security tool which supports the Zest spec.
